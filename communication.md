# Communication

## Remote communication
For apps like Slack, Teams, etc.

- Synchronous: Is it an emergency? Call or mark the requested groups and people. Describe the situation in few words.
- Asynchronous: Otherwise, send a message and dont expect immediate response

### Messages  
  
- Dont send just "hello" and wait for the response. Send "hello, can you send me the documents today?" and dont wait for the response
- Need attention for something important? Mark the required groups and people. Avoid call all the audience in the channels (`@here`, `@channel`).
