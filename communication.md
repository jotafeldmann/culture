# Communication

## Principles
- First the main reason (facts), then the details.
  - Example: "Hi, we got 100 errors this week, an increase of 25% in the last month. What do you think about more tests?"
- Use one word to express the same concept. Avoid different words around the same concept.

## Remote communication
For apps like Slack, Teams, etc.

- Synchronous: Is it an emergency? Call or mark the requested groups and people. Describe the situation in few words.
- Asynchronous: Otherwise, send a message and dont expect immediate response
- All channels act like long transient threads: try to keep transienty conversations in one place, and permanent in another.
  - The comments about the planning goes to the channel. The decisions for the planning goes in another place, maybe with a link in the channel.

### Channels  

- Use threads: avoid spamming the channels
- Dont send just "hello" and wait for the response. Send "hello, can you send me the documents today?" and dont wait for the response
- Need attention for something important? Mark the required groups and people. Avoid call all the audience in the channels (`@here`, `@channel`).
