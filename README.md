# Culture

## Why?
The purpose of this repo is act like a common place for culture documentation.

## Principles

- Use Git because it allows improvements using PRs and commits (discussing about the why, how, when, and who)
- Create centered topics in files
- Navigate the topics by the name of the files (avoid creating and updating an index for every new topic)
